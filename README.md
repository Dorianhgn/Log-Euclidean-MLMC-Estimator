# Log-Euclidean-MLMC-Variance-Estimator
As part of our research initiation project in the 4th year at INSA Toulouse, we studied the Multilevel Variance Estimator in log-Euclidean geometry.

The Python environment used to run these files is in `environment.yml`. To create it with conda, run in conda prompt or powershell (if conda is in the basic commands of powershell) under windows, or directly from a terminal under linux:

``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the created environment by running:

``` bash
conda activate Projet4A
```
